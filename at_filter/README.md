# Protocol-Inference-in-SDN-Environment
This project proposes an architecture of protocol Inference in SDN environment.

## Introduction
This is Network Protocol Inference of aSTEAM Project (Next-Generation Information Computing Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT). 
This software constructs SDN environment and inferences protocol state from unknown protocols. It basically consists of two sub-module referencing our KU-S-S-EM, KU-S-S-IM projects. 
The software improves state-of-the-art fuzzy inference systems for classifying traffic service types, performing the ability to detect abnormal traffic through inference flexibility regulation.


## Requirements and Dependencies
* OS : `Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS` ~ `Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS`
